/**
 * Public contract for a single on-disk index segment.
 * <p>
 * A segment stores a contiguous subset of the index, supports lookups and
 * iteration, accepts writes via a delta cache, and can be compacted or split
 * when it grows beyond configured limits. Implementations are responsible for
 * coordinating on-disk files, caches and statistics while keeping readers safe
 * through optimistic versioning.
 *
 * <strong>Thread-safety:</strong> Implementations are not thread-safe. If a
 * segment instance is accessed from multiple threads, callers must provide
 * external synchronization or higher-level concurrency control. The
 * {@link #getVersion()} and the use of optimistic locks guard readers against
 * in-place mutations, but do not make the segment API itself safe for
 * concurrent mutation.
 * 
 * Please note that any write operation could leads to segment compacting. So
 * write time could vary from fast operation (just write into cache) to long
 * operation (compact segment).
 *
 * <p>
 * Key responsibilities exposed by this API: - Query: {@link #get(Object)},
 * {@link #getStats()}, {@link #getNumberOfKeys()} - Writing (delta cache):
 * {@link #openDeltaCacheWriter()} - Maintenance: {@link #optionallyCompact()},
 * {@link #forceCompact()}, {@link #checkAndRepairConsistency()} - Splitting:
 * {@link #getSegmentSplitterPolicy()}, {@link #getSegmentSplitter()},
 * {@link #createSegmentWithSameConfig(SegmentId)} - Identity and lifecycle:
 * {@link #getId()}, {@link #getVersion()}, {@link #close()}
 *
