HestiaStore is a lightweight, embeddable key-value storage engine optimized for billions of records, designed to run in a single directory with high performance and minimal configuration.

	•	Java-based with minimum external dependencies
	•	Requires Java 17+
	•	In-memory or file-backed indexes
	•	Optional write-ahead logging
	•	Supports user-defined key/value types
	•	Optionaly could be thread safe

It's simple fast index. Work with index should be split into phases of:

* Writing data to index. All data that should be stored in index should be send to index.
* Building index. In this phase data are organized for fast access.
* Search through index. In this phase it's not possible to alter data in index.

Index is not thread safe.

## How to use HestiaStore

Index should be created with builder, which make index instance. For example:

```java
// Create an in-memory file system abstraction
final Directory directory = new MemDirectory();

// Prepare index configuration
final IndexConfiguration<String, String> conf = IndexConfiguration
        .<String, String>builder()//
        .withKeyClass(String.class)//
        .withValueClass(String.class)//
        .withName("test_index") //
        .build();

// create new index
Index<String, String> index = Index.<String, String>create(directory, conf);

// Do some work with the index
index.put("Hello", "World");

 String value = index.get("Hello");
System.out.println("Value for 'Hello': " + value);
```
