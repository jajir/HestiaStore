# 📖 Glossary

Concise definitions of terms used across HestiaStore’s architecture, with links and code pointers.

## 🧱 Segment
Bounded shard of the index stored on disk with its own files: main SST (`.index`), sparse index (`.scarce`), Bloom filter (`.bloom-filter`), properties, and optional delta caches. See also: On‑Disk Layout. Code: `segment/*`, `segmentindex/SegmentRegistry.java`.

## 🏷️ SegmentId
Stable integer id rendered as `segment-00000`, used to name per‑segment files. Code: `segment/SegmentId.java`.

## 🗺️ Key-to-Segment Map
Global sorted map of max key → SegmentId that routes lookups and flushes. Persisted as `index.map`. Code: `segmentindex/KeySegmentCache.java`.

## 📚 Main SST
On‑disk, chunked Sorted String Table containing sorted key/value entries for a segment. Code: `chunkentryfile/*`, `chunkstore/*`.

## 📦 Chunk
Fixed‑cell payload plus a small header (magic, version, payload length, CRC, flags). Filters may transform payload on write and are inverted on read. Code: `chunkstore/Chunk*.java`.

## 🧮 Delta Cache
Per‑segment overlay of recent updates, materialized as sorted `.cache` files and an in‑memory `UniqueCache` when loaded. Code: `segment/SegmentDeltaCache*.java`.

## 🧰 UniqueCache
In‑memory map that keeps only the latest value per key. Used at the index‑level write buffer and inside the delta overlay. Code: `cache/UniqueCache*.java`.

## 🚿 Flush
Drains the index‑level write buffer, routes entries to per‑segment delta caches, and updates `index.map`. Code: `segmentindex/SegmentIndexImpl#flush()`, `segmentindex/CompactSupport.java`.

## 🧹 Compaction
Segment rewrite that merges main SST with delta caches into fresh `.index`, `.scarce`, and `.bloom-filter` files, then clears delta caches. Code: `segment/SegmentCompacter.java`, `segment/SegmentFullWriter*.java`.

## ✂️ Split
When a segment grows beyond `maxNumberOfKeysInSegment`, it is split into two; `index.map` is updated with a new max key and SegmentId. Code: `segmentindex/SegmentSplitCoordinator.java`, `segment/SegmentSplitter*.java`.

## 🔍 Sparse SegmentIndex (Scarce Index)
Per‑segment, sorted sample of keys that points to chunk start positions in the main SST to bound local scans. Code: `scarceindex/*`.

## 🌸 Bloom Filter
Per‑segment probabilistic set that quickly proves absence and reduces on‑disk probes; rebuilt during compaction. Code: `bloomfilter/*`.

## 🧪 Filters (Chunk Filters)
Pluggable transformations applied to chunk payloads on write and inverted on read (magic number, CRC32, Snappy, XOR). Configured per index. Code: `chunkstore/ChunkFilter*.java`; config via `segmentindex/IndexConfigurationBuilder`.

## 🪦 Tombstone
Special value denoting deletion; read path treats it as absent and compaction drops obsolete values. Provided by the value type descriptor. Code: `datatype/TypeDescriptor#getTombstone()`, used in `segmentindex/SegmentIndexImpl#delete()`.

## 🧾 Entry
Immutable key/value pair used across iterators and writers. Code: `index/Entry.java`.

## 🔁 EntryIterator
Forward iterator over entries; variants exist for merging overlays and for safe iteration under writes (optimistic lock). Code: `index/EntryIterator.java`, `segment/MergeDeltaCacheWithIndexIterator.java`, `index/EntryIteratorWithLock.java`.

## ✍️ Write Transaction
Pattern that enforces open → close → commit, guaranteeing atomic file replacement. Code: `index/GuardedWriteTransaction.java`, `index/WriteTransaction.java`.

## 📁 Directory (Abstraction)
File I/O backend (FS, memory, zip) providing readers/writers and atomic rename. Code: `directory/*`.

## 🧩 SegmentData and Provider
 Lazy containers and providers for per‑segment heavyweight structures (delta cache, Bloom, sparse index). Often cached via LRU. Code: `segment/SegmentData*.java`, `segmentindex/SegmentDataCache.java`.

## 🪟 SegmentWindow
Offset/limit window for streaming across segments, analogous to SQL OFFSET/LIMIT. Code: `segmentindex/SegmentWindow.java`.

## 📊 Stats
Simple counters for get/put/delete to observe workload shape. Code: `segmentindex/Stats.java`.

## 🧰 Consistency Checker
Utilities to verify sortedness and segment/map coherence after unexpected shutdowns; can repair certain metadata issues. Code: `segmentindex/IndexConsistencyChecker.java`, `segment/SegmentConsistencyChecker.java`.

## 🗒️ Logging Context
Optional MDC enrichment that sets `index.name` for log correlation when enabled.
