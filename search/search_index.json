If the cache cannot recognize \u201cthe same key\u201d, duplicate keys can slip through.</li> <li>During flushing and compaction, keys are iterated in sorted order and written by <code>SortedDataFileWriter</code>.

If your comparator compares by content (e.g., lexicographically), then two different <code>byte[]</code> instances with the same content are NOT equal to <code>HashMap</code>, but ARE equal to the comparator.

This avoids having one part of the system see two objects as the same key while another part sees them as different. If you cannot satisfy this for a given JVM type (e.g., raw <code>byte[]</code>), wrap it in a type that does (e.g., <code>ByteArray</code>).</li> <li>Stable order vs. encoding: Keep the comparator consistent with the intended semantics of your keys and their encoding.

controlled JVM environment with identical JVM flags and hardware resources. Runs start by wiping the working directory supplied through the <code>dir</code> system property, so each trial writes into a fresh, empty location.</li> <li>Execution stays single-threaded from warm-up through measurement. The test focuses purely on how quickly one writer can push key/value pairs into the storage engine without any coordination overhead from additional threads.</li> <li>Warm-up phases fill the database as aggressively as possible for several 20-second stretches. This stage is meant to trigger JIT compilation, populate caches, and let LevelDB settle into steady-state behaviour before any numbers are recorded.</li> <li>Measurement phases repeat the same single-threaded write loop. Throughput is observed over multiple 20-second intervals to capture stable, sustained insert performance rather than a burst.</li> <li>Each write operation uses a deterministic pseudo-random long (seed <code>324432L</code>) to generate a unique hash string via <code>HashDataProvider</code>. The payload is the constant text <code>\"opice skace po stromech\"</code>, so variability comes exclusively from the changing keys.</li> <li>After measurements complete, the map is closed and the directory remains available for inspection. The log records how many keys were created, providing a quick sanity check that the run processed the expected volume.</li> <li>Test was performed at Mac mini 2024, 16 GB, macOS 15.6.1 (24G90).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"why-hestiastore/out-write/#benchmark-results","title":"\ud83c\udfc1 Benchmark Results","text":"Engine Score [ops/s] ScoreError Confidence Interval [ops/s] Occupied space CPU Usage ChronicleMap 5 954 1 765 4 189 .. 7 719 20.54 GB 7% H2 13 458 5 144 8 314 .. 18 601 8 KB 21% LevelDB 45 263 10 913 34 350 .. 56 176 1.4 GB 17% MapDB 2 946 326 2 620 .. 3 272 496 MB 14% RocksDB 305 712 78 929 226 783 .. 384 641 7.74 GB 6% <p>meaning of columns:</p> <ul> <li>Engine: name of the benchmarked engine (as derived from the JSON filename)</li> <li>Score [ops/s]: number of operations per second (higher is better)</li> <li>ScoreError: error margin of the score (lower is better).
